I am a research scientist at Intel Embodied AI Lab. I obtained my Ph.D at the [University of Adelaide](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/front/international.html?adobe_mc_sdid=SDID%3D5E6579FD63C20179-1A201BB23B2A1760%7CMCORGID%3DBA023B045D5A83160A495E49%40AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1692283744&adobe_mc_ref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F) (supervisor: [Prof. Tat-Jun Chin](https://cs.adelaide.edu.au/~ssl/) and [Prof. David Suter](https://ai-ecu.github.io/ECU-AI-Lab/dsuter/index.html)), where I studied fundamental computer vision problems such as robust fitting (estimating computer vision models under outlier contaminated data), multi-view geometry and point cloud processing. After joining Intel, my interests shift towards the mixture of machine learning and computer vision such as continual learning, 3D reconstruction, novel view synthesis etc.. My work has been selected as one of the 12 best papers of ECCV'18. I have (co-)supervised several Ph.D students/interns, send me an email if you are interested in collaboration/internships.
